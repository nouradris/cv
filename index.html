    <p>
      I am a 3rd year student at NJIT looking to possibly expand my knowledge
      from just the engineering field, and dive deep into the world of
      <strong>Web Development</strong>. I personally do not know still where I
      really want to go in life, but this class so far is interesting me in the
      Web Development Field. I am so far enjoying what I am doing, and looking
      forward to learning about the amazing world of Web Development. I also am
      the current <strong>Head Instructor of the Narts Dance Ensemble</strong>,
      which is the dance troupe of my Circassian community in the local area.
    </p>
    <p>
      I really do üíö my friends, my people, and my culture so much. No matter
      how far apart we are, or how often we see each other, I really do share
      that üíö with all of them. Even if I am not directly related to most
      people, they are all family to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I hope I will be able to develop myself
      <strong>(hah get it, develop. No? Okay sorry)</strong> as a person by
      learning this wonderful field. I can't wait to see what happens down the
      road for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, I would like to give a shoutout to Salih Kaplan for telling me about
      this course, and another shoutout to Jado Kojakali for telling Salih about
      this course
